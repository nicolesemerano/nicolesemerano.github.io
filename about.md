Hello!  My name is Nicole Semerano.  I am currently living 'upstate' in Harriman, NY.  I graduated with a BA from Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, VA.  The campus was on a former Civil War battlesite so it was only fitting that I was an American Studies major.  After that I got my Masters in Teaching Social Studies.  This started a 13 year career teaching Social Studies and Math.  I taught in various types of schools, from a juvenile detention centers to one of top 30 smallest schools in NY state, and others before and after.  Where does Data Science come into play, you ask?

I have always enjoyed analyzing data.  It could be data based on students or stats from my beloved Yankees. So it has been a natural transtion to Data Science.  Data Science combines the math and statistics I had been teaching for years with Python.  The Python language came very natural to me.  I have enthusiastically enjoyed learning the many ways Data Science can predict and analyze our lives with the features around us. I am eager to apply what I have learned to better help your business or surrounding community.
