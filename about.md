  Hello!  My name is Nicole Semerano.  I am currently living 'upstate' in Harriman, NY.  I graduated with a BA from Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, VA.  The campus was on a former Civil War battlesite so it was only fitting that I was an American Studies major.  After that I got my Masters in Teaching Social Studies.  This started a 13 year career teaching Social Studies and Math.  I taught in various types of schools, from a juvenile detention centers to one of top 30 smallest schools in NY state, and others before and after.  Where does Data Science come into play, you ask?  
</p>

I have always enjoyed analyzing data.  It could be data based on students or stats from my beloved Yankees. So it has been a natural transtion to Data Science.
In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
