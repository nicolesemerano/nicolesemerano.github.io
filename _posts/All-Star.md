title: "Are You An All-Star: My Classification Project"
---

#### By: Nicole Semerano

I was born into a baseball family.  I was raised a Yankees fan, but I have cousins who are Mets and Phillies fans.  So it was only natural that as I explored the Data Science world I complete a project based on baseball.  In this day and age there are so many statistics to choose from:  Player WAR rates, injury probability, where to start?  I decided to go a more classical route.  I will walk you through how I built a classification metric to determine whether a Major League Baseball player would classify as an All-Star.  I know as a fan the process can have its favorites.  Starting players are chosen by fans as a way to get people involved.  However, in some years the starting line-up is made of predominately New York, Boston, and California players.  Then the prior year's World Series manager chooses the auxilary players over a couple of rounds as players with injuries are replaced.  My goal in this classification system was to eliminate or less the bias in this process.
